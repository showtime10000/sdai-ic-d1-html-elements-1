## Description 📄
This lab introduces you to the fundamental building blocks of HTML webpages. You'll experiment with creating a simple webpage structure and observe how basic code translates into visual elements on a web page.

## Acceptance Criteria 📋
1. **File Navigation:** Navigate to index.html.
2. **Boilerplate Generation:** Use shortcuts to generate HTML boilerplate.
3. **H1 Tag Insertion:** Insert an H1 tag with ‘Hello world!’ in HTML body.
4. **Paragraph Tag Insertion:** Insert a paragraph tag with ‘lorem ipsum’ under H1 tag.

## ToDo list ✅
**Attention**: When you complete a task, put an `x` in the middle of the brackets to mark it off your ToDo list.

1. [ ] Navigate to the `index.html` file. 
2. [ ] In line 1, type an exclamation point and wait. What do you see?
3. [ ] Hit enter or tab to create the boilerplate codebase for HTML pages. 
4. [ ] Inside the body tag, put an H1 tag with 'Hello world!' in it. 
5. [ ] Under that, put a paragraph tag under that and type 'lorem ipsum'.
